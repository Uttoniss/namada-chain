## Overview

[Namada](http://namada.net) is a Proof-of-Stake L1 for interchain asset-agnostic privacy. Namada uses CometBFT
consensus and enables multi-asset shielded transfers for any native
or non-native asset. Namada features full IBC protocol support,
a natively integrated Ethereum bridge, a modern proof-of-stake
system with automatic reward compounding and cubic slashing, and a
stake-weighted governance signalling mechanism. Users of shielded
transfers are rewarded for their contributions to the privacy set in
the form of native protocol tokens. A multi-asset shielded transfer
wallet is provided in order to facilitate safe and private user
interaction with the protocol.

## Warning

> Here lay dragons: this codebase is still experimental, try at your own risk!

## üíæ Installing

You can use the node installation script available in this [repository](https://github.com/anoma/namada/blob/main/scripts/namadascript/README.md).

### Script Features

1. **Monitoring**
The script automatically fetches and displays:
   - Validator Details: Moniker, address, and balance.
   - Wallet Information: Name, address, and balance.
   - Node Block Height: Current block height.
   - Synchronization Status: Indicates if the node is still syncing or if it's already synchronized.
   - Service Status: Shows if the service is active or not.

2. **Main Management Menu**
   - Node Management: Options to install, uninstall, or restart the node.
   - Node Status Check: Features for checking the node logs, error journal, and service status.
   - Validator Management: Tools to check the validator's balance, initialize the validator, inspect staking, and facilitate delegation from the wallet or validator's address.
   - Token Request: A function to request tokens.
   - Exit: Option to close the script.

There is a single command to build and install Namada executables from source (the node, the client and the wallet). This command will also verify that a compatible version of [CometBFT](#dependencies) is available and if not, attempt to install it. Note that currently at least 16GB RAM is needed to build from source.

```shell
make install
```

After installation, the main `namada` executable will be available on path.

To find how to use it, check out the [User Guide section of the docs](https://docs.namada.net/user-guide/index.html).

For more detailed instructions and more install options, see the [Install
section](https://docs.namada.net/user-guide/install/index.html) of the User
Guide.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Development

```shell
# Build the provided validity predicate and transaction wasm modules
make build-wasm-scripts-docker

# Development (debug) build Namada, which includes a validator and some default 
# accounts, whose keys and addresses are available in the wallet
NAMADA_DEV=true make
```

### Before submitting a PR, pls make sure to run the following

```shell
# Format the code
make fmt

# Lint the code
make clippy
```

## üßæ Logging

To change the log level, set `NAMADA_LOG` environment variable to one of:

* `error`
* `warn`
* `info`
* `debug`
* `trace`

The default is set to `info` for all the modules, expect for CombetBFT ABCI, which has a lot of `debug` logging.

For more fine-grained logging levels settings, please refer to the [tracing subscriber docs](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/0.2.18/tracing_subscriber/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives) for more information.

To switch on logging in tests that use `#[test]` macro from `test_log::test`, use `RUST_LOG` with e.g. `RUST_LOG=info cargo test -- --nocapture`.

### Dependencies

The ledger currently requires [CometBFT v0.37.2](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v0.37.2) is installed and available on path. This can be achieved through following [these instructions](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/blob/main/docs/guides/install.md)
