## Economics

Namada users pay transaction fees in NAM and other tokens (see [fee system](./economics/fee-system.md) and [governance](./base-ledger/governance.md)), so demand for NAM can be expected to track demand for block space. On the supply side, the protocol mints NAM at a fixed maximum per-annum rate based on a fraction of the current supply (see [inflation system](./economics/inflation-system.md)), which is directed to three areas of protocol subsidy: [proof-of-stake](./economics/proof-of-stake.md), [shielded pool incentives](./economics/shielded-pool-incentives.md), and [public-goods funding](./economics/public-goods-funding.md). Inflation rates for these three areas are adjusted independently (the first two on PD controllers and the third based on funding decisions) and excess tokens are slowly burned.
