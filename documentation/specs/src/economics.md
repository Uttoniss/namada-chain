## Economics

Namada's economic model is based around a single native token, NAM, which is controlled by the protocol. Users pay transaction fees in NAM, with the gas price adjusted on a sliding P control (aka EIP 1559, described further in [fee system](./economics/fee-system.md), so demand for NAM can be expected to track demand for block space. Half of fees are paid to block producers and half are burnt. On the supply side, the protocol mints NAM at a fixed maximum per-annum rate based on a fraction of the current supply (see [inflation system](./economics/inflation-system.md)), which is directed to three areas of protocol subsidy: [proof-of-stake](./economics/proof-of-stake.md), [shielded pool incentives](./economics/shielded-pool-incentives.md), and [public-goods funding](./economics/public-goods-funding.md). Inflation rates for these three areas are adjusted independently (the first two on PD controllers and the third based on funding decisions) and excess tokens are slowly burned.
