## Inflation system

In general, inflation refers to the process of a currency losing its 
purchasing power over time. While this is a classical economic phenomenon, the way cryptocurrencies are produced permits great control over money supply, and doing so cleverly can have positive effects such as increasing incentives. Here we use "inflation" as a synonym for "token printing". The protocol controls the Namada token NAM (the native staking token), which is programmatically minted to pay for algorithmically measurable public goods - proof-of-stake security and shielded pool usage - and out-of-band public goods.

1. Proof-of-stake rewards, which are paid into the reward distribution mechanism in order to distribute them to validators and delegators.
2. Shielded pool rewards, which are locked in a way such that they can be eventually paid to users who kept tokens in the shielded pool.
3. Public goods funding, split into proactive and retroactive versions, which is paid partially continuously and partially on a regular cadence.

### Proof-of-stake rewards

When validators are selected they need to be backed by funds. These funds are locked for the duration of an epoch and 21 days after the epoch has ended. Locked tokens help secure the system while liquidity supports its activity and liveness. We need to choose the ratio between locked and liquid tokens carefully. Liquid tokens make sure the price of the token is not increasing out of scarcity and users have access to tokens to pay transaction fees, while locked tokens are the guarantee that attacking the system is expensive for an adversary.

Jacob: Staked funds are variably locked. I think you mean the the bonding period
is one epoch and unbounding is something like 21 days.

Here are some numbers from other projects

| Blockchain platform | Approximate locking %       |
|--------------------------------------------------|------|
| Cosmos                                           | 66.7 |
| Polkadot                                         | 50   |
| Ethereum                                         | 47   |
| Solana                                           | 77   |


The desired percentage for Namada is 33%-66%: Locked for validating and the 
rest %33-%66 is liquid. When the price of the token is low we can aim for a 
higher % of locked tokens and reduce this as the price and demand for liquid 
tokens increases. For example, we can set a range, in the beginning have 50 % 
and later aim for 1/3. It should not go lower than that. The staking reward 
should be ideally set.

In Polkadot and Cosmos the total inflation rate that is paid as rewards to validators depends on the staking ratio. This is to incentivize validators and delegators to invest in the staking pool. We will follow the same idea and have inflation vary depending on our target staking ratio. Here is how we achieve that.

###  Net inflation model

Let us assume $T$ is the total token supply and $I$ is the total inflation of Namada. 

$$I=\frac{T_\textrm{end of year}-T_\textrm{beginning of year}}{T_\textrm{beginning of year}}$$

The total inflation consists of several components as follows. 

$$I=I_{PoS}+I_L+I_T-D_T$$

where $I_T$ is our inflation that goes to treasury, $I_{PoS}$ is inflation 
that is paid as PoS rewards, and $I_L$ is the inflation for locking that is 
paid to accounts in shielded pool. We can extend the formula to many 
types, $I_{L_1},\dots,I_{L_n}$. For simplicity, we assume we have only one 
type, $I_L$. $D_T$ is the constant deflation of the treasury. This is applied to
incentivize governance voters to spend treasury funds. 

These components are each varying depending on independent factors as follows. The $I_{PoS}$ depends on the staking ratio $R(t)$. The locking inflation $I_L$ depends on the locking ratio $L(t)$. Ideally we want the total token supply to consist of tokens locked for staking and shielded pool and the rest are liquid tokens $Y$. 

$$T=T*R_{target}+T*L_{target}+Y$$

where $R_{target}$ is the target staking ratio and $L_{target}$ is the target locking of assets in the shielded pool.
  
We assume further assume $I_{target}$ is our target total inflation that we want to achieve on the long term, where we split it up into $I_{PoS,target}$ and $I_{L,target}$ for staking and locking respectivly. 

We define $I_{PoS}$ as a PD controller as follows. 

$$A(t)=K_1(R(t)-R_{target})+K_2(\frac{dR}{dt})$$

If $I_{PoS}^{min}< I_{PoS}< I_{PoS}^{max}$ then $\frac{dI_{PoS}}{dt}=A(t)$.

If $I_{PoS}^{min}< I_{PoS}$ then $\frac{dI_{PoS}}{dt}=max(A(t),0)$.

If $I_{PoS}< I_{PoS}^{max}$ then $\frac{dI_{PoS}}{dt}=min(A(t),0)$.

For $I_{PoS}^{min}=0.05$, $I_{PoS}^{max}=0.15$, $I_{PoS,target}=0.10$, and $R_{target}=0.50$ we set $K_1=-0.01$ and $K_2=-0.2$. Lets review what these parameters give us with examples as follows. 

**Example 1:** If $I= I_{PoS,target}=0.10$ and $R_{target}=0.50$, but then $R$ drops quickly to $0.25$, then the effect of the $K_2$ term will be to increase $I_{PoS}$ by $-0.2 \times -0.25=0.05$ and inflation will hit its maximum value of $0.15$. Changes in $R$ smaller than $0.25$ will not cause inflation to hit its maximum or minimum quickly.

**Example 2:** If $I_{PoS}=0.05$, but $R$ holds steady at $0.40$, then $K_1$ term will cause $I$ to increase by $-0.01 \times -0.10=0.001$ per day/epoch. $I_{PoS}$ will take 100 days to reach its maximum. This is slow compared to the unbonding period, allowing delegators time to react.


---

We define $I_{L}$ as a PD controller follows. 

$$A(t)=K_1(L(t)-L_{target})+K_2(\frac{dL}{dt})$$

If $I_{L}^{min}< I_{L}< I_{L}^{max}$ then $\frac{dI_{L}}{dt}=A(t)$.

If $I_{L}^{min}< I_{L}$ then $\frac{dI_{L}}{dt}=max(A(t),0)$.

If $I_{L}< I_{L}^{max}$ then $\frac{dI_{L}}{dt}=min(A(t),0)$.

For $I_{L}^{min}=0.03$, $I_{L}^{max}=0.07$, $I_{L,target}=0.05$, and $L_{target}=0.30$ we set $K_1=-0.05$ and $K_2=-0.1$. Lets review what these parameters give us with examples as follows. 

**Example 1:** If $I= I_{L,target}=0.05$ and $L_{target}=0.30$, but then $L$ drops quickly to $0.15$, then the effect of the $K_2$ term will be to increase $I_L$ by $-0.1 \times -0.15=0.015$ and inflation will hit $0.065$ which is short of its maximum value of $0.07$. Changes in $L$ smaller than $0.15$ will not cause inflation to hit its maximum or minimum quickly.

**Example 2:** If $I_{L}=0.03$, but $L$ holds steady at $0.20$, then $K_1$ term will cause $I_L$ to increase by $-0.05 \times -0.10=0.005$ per day/epoch. $I_{L}$ will take 8 days to reach its maximum. 

TODO: Why we chose those min and max values. 
TODO: Dt and It based on Chris proposal

The ratio between staking and locking in the shielded pool is a trade off between security, privacy, and liveness. A higher staking ratio means more security, a higher locking ratio means more privacy, and if both are too high there wont be enough liquidity for transactions. It would be easier to consider these separately, for example, setting the target staking ratio to 50 % and the target locking ratio to 30 %. 

The funds minted for the treasury is a constant %, for example 1 %. Same goes for $D_T$. 

We need to define $I_{PoS}^{max}$, $I_{L}^{max}$, and $I_{T}$ to bound total inflation. 

$$I_{PoS}^{max}+I_{L}^{max}+I_T=< I^{max}$$

The sum of $I_L$ and other $I_L1, ..., I_Ln$ will also be limited. If their sum would exceed the limit, then we need to scale them down to stay within the limit. 

These bounds on $I_{PoS}$ and $I_L$ give us a min and max bound on the total inflation, where the total inflation depends on $L_{target}$ and $R_{target}$ independently.

### Shielded pool rewards

The privacy that MASP is providing depends on the asset in the shielded pool. A transaction can only be private if it can hide among other transactions, hence more funds and activity in the shielded pool increase privacy for transactions.

### Public goods funding

10% per annum. See [public goods funding](./public-goods-funding.md).
